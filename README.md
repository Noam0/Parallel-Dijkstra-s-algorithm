# Parallel-Dijkstra-s-algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm in C with MPI and OpenMP for finding shortest distances in a graph. Parallel and sequential processing with dynamic load balancing.

This project presents an efficient parallel implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest distances in a weighted graph.
It leverages the power of both MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed computing and OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) for shared-memory parallelism.
The result is a high-performance solution for graph traversal and distance calculation.
